Under construction! 

This site is a showcase for my github projects! Visit my personal site? [https://chinanwu.com](https://chinanwu.com)

## Design
I designed the entire site! I even created the icons utilized. Figma was a great tool for doing this. Peek below for some behind the scenes and what I had initially planned for the site to look like (I think I implemented quite well!):
