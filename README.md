# chinanwu.github.io

Good news gang! I finally bought a domain and created my own spankin new website! Check it out at chinanwu.com

### Tools
Some tools I used when creating this site:

> https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ 

To make sure fonts are at least at the WCAG AA level. 

> https://www.materialui.co/colors

For the wonderful colours
